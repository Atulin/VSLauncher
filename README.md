After I sterted using Jetbrains products for webdev, I got really accustomed to the Toolbox. Quick access to all recent projects turned out to be invaluable. That was the thing I've been missing in Visual Studio.

To open a solution in VS, I had to either browse the files on my disks, or open VS, wait for it to load, wait for ReSharper to load, and then find it on the list. This cool little utility skips the first two steps completely.

## Features

* Crawls multiple directories in search for projects (add them in settings menu)
* Launches Visual Studio straight from the projects list
* Displays creation date, last edit date, and last open date of all solutions
* Super quick and super light!

## Todo

* Searching through the list of projects
* Sorting the projects
* Pinning projects to favourites
